# **Echo State Network Architecture Ground Rules**

Article: [Link](#http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Echo_state_network?source=post_page-----f910809d23d4----------------------)

1. **Random RNN Design**: Create a random, large, fixed recurrent neural network (RNN) as the reservoir. The reservoir size `N` is task-dependent, and the neuron model can be any type (e.g., non-spiking leaky integrator neurons).
2. **Input-Reservoir Connections**: Attach input units to the reservoir by creating random all-to-all connections.
3. **Output Units**: Create output units and install randomly generated output-to-reservoir connections (all-to-all) if output feedback is required. Otherwise, do not create any connections.
4. **State Harvesting**: Drive the dynamical reservoir with training data `D` for times `n=1,…,n_max`. Write both the input `u(n)` and teacher output `y(n)` into the input and output units, respectively, if output feedback is required.
5. **Compute Output Weights**: Compute the output weights as the linear regression weights of the teacher outputs `y(n)` on the reservoir states `x(n)`. Use these weights to create reservoir-to-output connections.
6. **System Equations**: Use the state update equation (1) and output equation (2) to govern the ESN behavior, where `x(n)` is the reservoir state, `f` is a sigmoid function, `W` is the reservoir weight matrix, `W_in` is the input weight matrix, `u(n)` is the input signal, `W_fb` is the output feedback matrix, and `y(n)` is the output signal.
7. **Learning Equations**: In the state harvesting stage, use the system equations (1) and (2) to generate extended system states `z(n)`. If output feedback is included, write the correct outputs `d(n)` into the output units during state generation.
8. **Regularization**: Regularization techniques can be applied to prevent overfitting, such as margin-maximization criteria or least-mean-square error solutions.
9. **Variants**: Explore different neuron types, reservoir-internal connectivity patterns, and output weight computation algorithms to adapt the ESN architecture to specific tasks.

These ground rules provide a foundation for building an ESN architecture with high potential for proper functioning. However, the specific implementation details may vary depending on the task requirements and the desired level of complexity.

# **A Practical Guide to Applying Echo State Networks**

## Equations

1. **27.3 ==> x(n) = (1 - α)x(n - 1) + αx˜(n)**

- x(n) is the state of the reservoir at time step n
- x(n - 1) is the previous state of the reservoir
- α is the leak rate, a parameter that controls the amount of information retained from the previous state
- x˜(n) is the input to the reservoir at time step n

2. **27.3 ==> y(n) = W^out^[1; u(n); x(n)]**

- y(n) ∈ R^(N(y))^ is network output
- W^out^ ∈ R^N(y)×(1+N(u)+N(x))^
- [ ; ] stands for vertical vector or matrix concatenations

3. **27.9 ==> W^out^ = Y^target^X^T^ (XX^T^ + βI)^−1^**

- β is the regularization coefficient
- I is the identity matrix

4. **27.9 ==> W^out^ = Y^target^X^+^**

- X^+^ is the moonre-penrose pseudoinverse of X [ the genralization of inverse of X ]

5. **27.16 ==>**
   ![alt text](image.png)

- Σx is a shorthand for [1; u(n); x(n)] time-averaged over τ

6. **27.18 ==> x˜(n) = tanh(W^in^[1; u(n)] + Wx(n − 1) + W^fb^y(n − 1))**

## Guidelines

1. For challenging tasks use as big a reservoir as you can afford computationally.
2. Select global parameters with smaller reservoirs, then scale to bigger ones.
3. Nx should be at least equal to the estimate of independent real values the reservoir has to remember from the input to solve its task.
4. N~x~ should be at least equal to the estimate of
   independent real values the reservoir has to remember
   from the input to solve its task.
5. Connect each reservoir node to a small fixed number of other nodes (e.g., 10) on average, irrespective of the reservoir size. Exploit this reservoir sparsity to
   speedup computation.
6. ρ(W) < 1 ensures echo state property in most situations.
7. The spectral radius should be greater in tasks requiring longer memory of the input.
8. Scale the whole W^in^ uniformly to have few global parameters in ESN. However, to increase the performance:

- scale the first column of W^in^ (i.e., the bias inputs) separately;
- scale other columns of W^in^ separately if channels of u(n) contribute differently to the task.

9. It is advisable to normalize the data and may help to keep the inputs u(n) bounded avoiding outliers (e.g., apply tanh(·) to u(n) if it is unbounded).
10. The input scaling regulates:

- the amount of nonlinearity of the reservoir representation x(n) (also increasing with ρ(W));
- the relative effect of the current input on x(n) asopposed to the history (in proportion to ρ(W)).

11. Set the leaking rate α in (27.3) to match the speed of the dynamics of u(n) and/or y^target^(n).
12. The main three parameters to optimize in an ESN reservoir are:

- input scaling(-s);
- spectral radius;
- leaking rate(-s).

13. The most pragmatic way to evaluate a reservoir is to train the output (27.4) and measure its error.
14. To eliminate the random fluctuation of performance, keep the random seed fixed and/or average over several reservoir samples.
15. When manually tuning the reservoir parameters, change one parameter at a time.
16. Always plot samples of reservoir activation signals x(n) to have a feeling of what is happening inside the reservoir.
17. The most generally recommended way to learn linear output weights from an ESN is ridge regression (27.9)

18. Extremely large W^out^ values may be an indication of a very sensitive and unstable solution.
19. Use regularization (e.g., (27.9)) whenever there is a danger of overfitting or feedback instability.
20. Select β for a concrete ESN using validation, without rerunning the reservoir through the training data.
21. With large datasets collect the matrices (Y^target^X^T^) and (XX^T^) incrementally for (27.9).
22. With very large datasets, a more accurate summation scheme should be used for accumulating (Y^target^X^T^) and (XX^T^).
23. Use direct pseudoinverse (27.12) to train ESNs with high precision and little regularization when memory and run time permit.

24. For high precision tasks, check whether the regression (y^target^ − W^out^X)X+ on the error y^target^ − W^out^X is actually all = 0, and add it to W^out^ if it is not.
25. Averaging outputs from multiple reservoirs increases the performance.
26. For long sequences discard the initial time steps of activations x(n) for training that are affected by initial transient.
27. Use weighting to assign different importance to different time steps when training.
28. To classify sequences, train and use readouts from time-averaged activations Σx (27.16), instead of x(n).
29. Concatenate weighted time-averages over different intervals to read out from for an even more powerful classification.
30. Different powerful classification methods for static data can be employed as the readout from the time-averaged activations Σ~∗~x
31. Use output feedbacks to the reservoir only if they are necessary for the task.
32. For simple tasks, feed y^target^(n) instead of y(n) in (27.18) while learning to break the recurrence.
33. Regularization by ridge regression or noise is crucial to make teacher-forced feedbacks stable.

# **Analysis and Design of Echo State Netoworks**

The article "Analysis and Design of Echo State Networks" by Ozturk, Xu, and Príncipe (2007) is a technical paper on the topic of Echo State Networks (ESNs) in neural computation. ESNs are a type of recurrent neural network that can learn complex patterns in data, particularly in time series and signal processing applications.

**Key Features of ESNs**

- **State-Space Representation**: ESNs are characterized by their state-space representation, which consists of a set of internal nodes (or neurons) that interact with each other through a complex network of connections.
- **Echo State Property**: The authors introduce the concept of the "echo state property," which refers to the ability of ESNs to learn long-term dependencies in data. This property is a result of the internal dynamics of the network, which can be tuned to capture patterns in the data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: ESNs can learn patterns in data without the need for explicit supervision or labeling. This makes them suitable for applications where labeled data is scarce or difficult to obtain.

**Design and Analysis of ESNs**

- **Architecture**: The authors present a detailed description of the ESN architecture, including the internal nodes, connections, and learning rules.
- **Training Methods**: The authors discuss various training methods for ESNs, including online and offline learning, and provide a detailed analysis of their performance.
- **Performance Evaluation**: The authors present a comprehensive evaluation of ESNs, including their ability to learn complex patterns in data, their robustness to noise and outliers, and their computational efficiency.

**Mathematical Formulation of ESNs**

- **Internal Dynamics**: The authors provide a mathematical formulation of the internal dynamics of ESNs, including the equations that govern the behavior of the internal nodes.
- **Learning Rules**: The authors present a detailed description of the learning rules used in ESNs, including the equations that govern the adaptation of the internal connections.
- **Stability Analysis**: The authors perform a stability analysis of ESNs, including a detailed discussion of the conditions under which the network converges to a stable state.
